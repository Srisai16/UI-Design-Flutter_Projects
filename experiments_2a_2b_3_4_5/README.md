# 🗂 Experiments_2-5


A collection of Flutter experiments set up to explore key Flutter widgets, layout systems, responsiveness, navigation, and state management. This repo is intended for learning and prototyping, demonstrating how to build small UI features and behaviors.

- `lib/`: contains the main Dart / Flutter code for experiments.
- `android/`, `ios/`, `web/`, `windows/`, `macos/`, `linux/`: platform-specific folders generated by Flutter.
- `test/`: for unit/widget tests (if any).
- `pubspec.yaml`: dependencies and configuration.
- `README.md`: this documentation.

## 🎯 Purpose

These experiments are designed to help you:

1. Understand basic Flutter widgets (e.g. `Text`, `Image`, `Container`).
2. Learn layout mechanisms using `Row`, `Column`, `Stack`.
3. Make responsive UI designs using media queries and breakpoints.
4. Implement navigation between screens, including named routes.
5. Learn and contrast stateless/stateful widgets, and manage state using `setState` and a more scalable pattern (e.g. `Provider`).

## 🧪 Experiments & Implementation Details

Below are the key experiment topics and how they can/might be implemented in this repo.

| # | Topic | What to Explore / Implement |
|---|-------|------------------------------|
| **2a** | **Flutter Widgets** | Use `Text`, `Image`, `Container`, `Padding`, `SizedBox`, `Icon`, etc. Create small widgets showing different styles, fonts, colors, and using images (network/local). Apply decoration, borders, background colors. |
| **2b** | **Layouts (Row, Column, Stack)** | Build UI screens using `Column` for vertical stacks, `Row` for horizontal, and `Stack` for overlapping content. Explore alignment, spacing, expanded/flexible widgets. |
| **3a** | **Responsive UI** | Design UI that adapts to screen sizes (phones, tablets). Use `LayoutBuilder`, fractional sizing, flexible layouts. |
| **3b** | **Media Queries & Breakpoints** | Use `MediaQuery.of(context).size` or `MediaQuery.of(context).orientation`. Define breakpoints (e.g. small, medium, large) and conditionally layout or style the UI accordingly. |
| **4a** | **Navigation** | Have multiple screens/pages. Use `Navigator.push(...)` and `Navigator.pop(...)` for transitions. Demonstrate passing arguments between screens. |
| **4b** | **Named Routes** | In `MaterialApp` define routes via `routes:` map and use `Navigator.pushNamed(...)`, `Navigator.popNamed(...)`. |
| **5a** | **Stateless vs Stateful** | Build examples of stateless widgets (pure UI), and stateful widgets (with internal state). E.g. toggles, counter, input fields. |
| **5b** | **State Management: setState vs Provider** | First, use `setState` inside StatefulWidgets to manage local state. Then integrate `Provider` (or another state management package) to manage shared/app-level state (e.g. theme, user settings). |

## 🔧 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Flutter installed and configured.
2. Clone the repo:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Srisai16/UI-Design-Flutter_Projects.git
    cd experiments-all
    ```

3. Get dependencies:

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

4. Start an experiment – either in emulator, physical device, or browser (`flutter run -d <device>`).

5. If adding a new experiment: add new file in `lib/`, update `main.dart` (or an experiment router), so you can navigate to it.

## 📐 Example: Responsive Layout & Routes Example Implementation

Below is an example pattern to use in this repo for implementing experiments 3 & 4:

```dart
// main.dart
void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext c) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Experiments All',
      initialRoute: '/',
      routes: {
        '/': (c) => HomeScreen(),
        '/widgets': (c) => WidgetsDemoScreen(),
        '/layout': (c) => LayoutDemoScreen(),
        '/responsive': (c) => ResponsiveDemoScreen(),
        // etc
      },
    );
  }
}
````

In `ResponsiveDemoScreen` you might use:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  var size = MediaQuery.of(context).size;
  if (size.width < 600) {
    // small screen layout
  } else {
    // wide screen layout
  }
}
```

## ⚙️ Notes & Best Practices

- Keep experiments small and focused; each should illustrate one concept clearly.
- When dealing with images (network/local), handle loading and placeholders.
- Keep stateful widgets as minimal as possible: lift state up when needed.
- Use Provider or another package for shared/global state rather than passing via constructors everywhere.
- Test on multiple screen sizes/emulators to verify responsiveness.

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Add unit and widget tests for each experiment.
- Add more state management options (Bloc, Riverpod).
- Add theming/dark mode experiment.
- Accessibility experiments: fonts scaling, semantics labels.
