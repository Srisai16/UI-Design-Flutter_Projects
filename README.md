# Flutter Experiments

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

This repository contains a structured set of **Flutter experiments** designed to help students progressively learn **Flutter and Dart**. The experiments cover everything from environment setup, language basics, UI layouts, and navigation, to advanced concepts like animations, API integration, and state management.

---

# ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:

- Provide hands-on experience in **Flutter app development**.
- Explore **UI design patterns**, **responsiveness**, and **state management**.
- Learn **best practices** for building scalable, maintainable, and interactive mobile applications.
- Experiment with **real-world use cases** such as form validation, API integration, and animations.

## ðŸ§ª List of Experiments & Implementation

### **1. Environment Setup**

- Install Flutter and Dart SDK.
- Configure IDE (Android Studio/VS Code).
- Write a simple Dart program to understand syntax, variables, loops, and functions.

### **2. Flutter Widgets & Layouts**

- Explore basic widgets: `Text`, `Image`, `Container`, `Scaffold`.
- Implement layouts using `Row`, `Column`, and `Stack`.

### **3. Responsive UI**

- Design interfaces that adapt to different screen sizes.
- Use `MediaQuery` and `LayoutBuilder` for responsive design.
- Implement breakpoints for mobile and tablet.

### **4. Navigation**

- Use `Navigator.push()` and `Navigator.pop()` for basic screen transitions.
- Implement **named routes** for cleaner navigation between multiple screens.

### **5. Stateful & Stateless Widgets**

- Understand lifecycle of `StatelessWidget` and `StatefulWidget`.
- Manage state with `setState`.
- Explore state management with **Provider** for scalable apps.

### **6. Custom Widgets & Styling**

- Create **reusable custom widgets** for buttons, cards, etc.
- Apply theming and custom styles using `ThemeData` and `MaterialApp`.

### **7. Forms & Validation**

- Design forms with inputs like `TextField`, `Checkbox`, `RadioButton`.
- Implement validation for email, password, and required fields.
- Handle error messages and form submission.

### **8. Animations**

- Use Flutterâ€™s animation framework to add transitions.
- Implement fade, scale, and slide animations.
- Experiment with `AnimatedContainer`, `AnimatedOpacity`, and `Hero` widgets.

### **9. REST API Integration**

- Fetch live data from a REST API using `http` package.
- Parse JSON data and display it in a `ListView`.
- Handle loading states and error handling.
